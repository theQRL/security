## 2. Download security@theqrl.org GPG public key

**Either:**

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theQRL/security/master/security.theqrl.org.gpg.asc | gpg --import
```

**or:**

```
gpg --search-keys security@theqrl.org
```
should yield:

> gpg: data source: https://keys.openpgp.org:443
(1)  Security team <security@theqrl.org>
    4096 bit RSA key 14762269BFDD11F3, created: 2019-02-16

selecting key 1 will add the key to your keychain

- [v1.7.3](1.7.3)
- [v1.7.0](1.7.0)
- [v1.6.6](1.6.6)

## 4. Verify the signaure of the SHASUM file

```

## 5. Check the SHASUM of the downloaded wallet package

LINUX-x64_QRL-Wallet_1.8.1.deb: OK
```
